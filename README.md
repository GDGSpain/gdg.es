## Prerequisites

First, install the dependencies:

    npm install

## Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start

## Build

The included `gulpfile.js` relies on [the `polymer-build` library](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-build),
the same library that powers Polymer CLI. Out of the box it will clean the
`build` directory, and provide image minification. Follow the comments in the
`gulpfile.js` to add additional steps like JS transpilers or CSS preprocessors.

Also, generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the dependencies
based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.

    npm run build

## Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`:

    npm start -- build/


## Run lint

This command will run [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint):

```
npm run lint
```

## Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    npm test

## Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections of the
application. Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the list of
`fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file. This will ensure those
components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached components
and will be included in the `bundled` build.
